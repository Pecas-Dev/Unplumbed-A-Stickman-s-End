# Unplumbed A Stickman's End
 Unplumbed: A Stickman's End is my first game for a Game Jam. Made in Unity2D. 
 
The game is a mix of a Platformer and Adventure genres, with a storyline centered on a stickman who died in a hangman game. However, something extraordinary happened - the drawings on the hangman paper came to life, resulting in the stickman's body breaking into three parts (legs, torso & arms, and head) and scattering across different drawings. As a stickman, the player can control each body part separately, with the ultimate goal of retrieving all the scattered parts and becoming whole again. This is necessary to save other stickmen from experiencing the same fate as the protagonist. The player holds the fate of these stickmen in their hands.
